## What is this? (And why is it called "actornot")

**actornot-go** (from the Russian "–Ω–µ–¥–æ–∞–∫—Ç—ë—Ä" ‚Äî literally, "not quite an actor") is a Go library for building actor-like, distributed, and *serverless-friendly* systems. It's for when you want the coolness of the Actor Model, but your cloud is stateless, your database is your only friend, and your serverless functions keep ghosting you.

**TL;DR:**
- You want per-entity (user/session/chat) sequential processing.
- You want to scale horizontally, crash safely, and never lose a message.
- You want to do this in a stateless, serverless, or distributed environment where in-memory actors are a no-go.

## Why should you care?

Traditional actor systems (like Akka, Erlang, protoactor-go) are awesome... until you deploy them to serverless or distributed cloud, and suddenly your actors forget who they are every time the pod restarts. *Persistence is hard!* This library gives you actor-like behavior ‚Äî but with all state, locks, and queues living in your database (MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, whatever). No more memory loss!

- **Serverless/Cloud Native**: Survives pod evictions, cold starts, and cloud drama.
- **Distributed**: Multiple instances? No problem. Only one processes a given entity at a time.
- **Crash-safe**: Locks expire, so if your function dies, another picks up the slack.
- **No message left behind**: Events are queued and processed in order, even if your infra is chaos.

## How does it work?

- **MailboxPoster**: The main star. Posts messages to a distributed queue, grabs a lock, and processes them one at a time ‚Äî *per entity*. It also calls `UpdateLocked` for you automagically after each processing step, so you don't have to worry about updating or releasing locks yourself.
- **LockableQueue**: Abstracts your DB-backed queue and distributed lock. Plug in MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, etc.
- **Envelope**: Wraps your message with context (like user ID).
- **Runner**: You implement the logic for processing a locked entity (`RunLocked`), and how to acquire the lock, but the mailbox wires everything up and keeps the loop running for you.

All the hard stuff (locking, batching, retries, crash recovery) is handled for you. You just write your business logic.

## Example: Counter with MongoDB

Here's a taste from the [counter example](examples/counter-example):

```go
// RunLocked processes all events for a single entity (user) while holding the distributed lock.
// This is the *only* place in your entire cloud of functions/servers where the state for this entity
// is actually mutated and business logic is applied. The distributed locking mechanism ensures that,
// at any given time, only one instance of RunLocked is executing for a particular user (state),
// even if there are many servers or goroutines running in parallel. This provides strong sequential
// processing guarantees and prevents race conditions or double-processing.
func (r *CounterRunner) RunLocked(state *State) {
    // IMPORTANT: Clear processed events from memory.
    events := state.Events
    state.Events = nil

    // BATCH PROCESSING: Process all events in the current batch.
    totalDelta := int64(0)
    for _, event := range events {
        totalDelta += event.Delta
    }
    state.Counter += totalDelta
}
```

This is the only place you should ever mutate per-entity state in your distributed/serverless setup. The mailbox will call this for you, with all the locking and updating handled automagically.

## Quickstart

1. **Run the example:**

```bash
cd examples/counter-example
MONGO_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017' go run main.go
```

2. **Try it out:**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/webhook?user_id=alice&delta=5'
curl 'http://localhost:8080/status?user_id=alice'
```

## Features
- ‚ö° **Serverless-friendly**: Survives cold starts, pod evictions, and cloud chaos.
- üîí **Distributed locks**: Only one instance processes an entity at a time.
- üì® **Event queue**: No message left behind. Events are processed in order.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Pluggable backend**: Use MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, or anything you can lock.
- üí• **Crash-safe**: Locks expire, so work always resumes.
- ü¶æ **Horizontal scaling**: Add more instances, process more entities in parallel.
- üòé **Modern Go**: Generics, interfaces, and a sprinkle of existential dread.

## The Name: "–Ω–µ–¥–æ–∞–∫—Ç—ë—Ä" (actornot)

In Russian, "–Ω–µ–¥–æ–∞–∫—Ç—ë—Ä" means "not quite an actor" ‚Äî and that's exactly what this is. It's not a full-blown actor system, but it's got enough actor energy to get you through the distributed trenches. Like an actor who never made it to Hollywood, but still gets the job done in your serverless backend.
